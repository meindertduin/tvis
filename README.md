## Requirements
- `fftw` (a library for performantly calculating the [DFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform))
- `cmake` (library used for building the project)
- `libpulse-dev` for the pulse-audio development libraries

As of right now this tvis has only support for machines using pulse-audio. But more sources are soon to be added!
